# AirBNC - Vacation Property Listing App 
(under developmemnt)

## Description

The application fetches data from a database and dynamically displays properties based on user preferences.

Users can:
- Browse and filter vacation properties by price or popularity.
- View detailed property information, including pricing, host details, and availability.
- Mark properties as favorites for easy access later.
- Book properties, edit and delete bookings, and retrieve past reservations.
- Leave and delete reviews for properties they’ve stayed in.
- Leave ratings for properties they’ve stayed in.
- Update their user profile, including name, email, phone number, and avatar.

Built with **React**, **Node.js**, **Express**, and **PostgreSQL**, this app provides a seamless and responsive experience for users looking for vacation rentals.
